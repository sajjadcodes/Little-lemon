# Little-lemon
## Goal

The Course Assessment will require learner to build the two pages of the web app and be split majorly into two parts:

Create the Menu page

Create the Menu Item page

## Scenario

By now you are fairly familiar with the aspirations of the owners Mario and Adrian in providing the best experience to their customers.

While Little Lemon is a local neighborhood bistro, both the owners have long understood the importance of digital presence as a means of convenience and connection for their visitors.

So far, you have helped Little Lemon by building a prototype of their website using the Django framework.

You have been instrumental in testing different website components, from creating views to dynamic templates and building models and forms.

It is now time to bring it all together and help finish the website already under construction by completing the most critical aspect of a food restaurant website, its Menu page!

Learner Instructions

The Little Lemon website will consist of five pages:

- Home

- About

- Booking

- Menu

- Menu Item
